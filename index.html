Relay important information and update the team based information from coach
As an elementary art school teacher, my summer role involves teaching children aged 5 to 12 how to draw, paint, and engage in various forms of coloring. This summer camp runs from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., five days a week. Each week, I create a curriculum centered around a different theme, allowing the children to explore diverse artistic concepts and techniques. I provide step-by-step art demonstrations that guide the kids through the creative process, ensuring they feel confident as they experiment with their artistic skills. Additionally, I incorporate fun games during their breaks, promoting a joyful and energetic environment where learning and play coexist harmoniously.
In addition to my teaching responsibilities, I serve as the Public Relations Chair for UCR's Katipunan, a Pilipino student-led organization on campus. In this role, I design eye-catching graphics for every event throughout the academic year. My responsibilities include coordinating with my Co-Chair to brainstorm innovative ideas and plan future graphics that resonate with our community's interests. To enhance event visibility, I actively market and post about upcoming events on social media, aiming to increase turnout and excitement. Collaborating with other board members is crucial; I reach out to gain insight into their visions for events, ensuring that these ideas are effectively reflected in the promotional materials I create.
Furthermore, I am a dedicated member of the Marketing and Design team, where I design infographics and merchandise that capture the essence of our events. Attending team meetings allows me to discuss graphics and share ideas that contribute to the overall aesthetic we aim to maintain, particularly on our Instagram feed. My commitment to creating a visually appealing online presence is essential in fostering engagement within our community.
Alongside my academic and extracurricular involvement, I participated in the Philippine American Culture Night (PACN) internship. During this experience, I shadowed dance coaches, directors, and coordinators, gaining valuable insights into their roles and contributions to the performances. This hands-on experience not only enriched my understanding of cultural representation through dance but also provided me with the opportunity to design posters that promote the event. Working closely with my peers, we efficiently divided responsibilities to accomplish our goals and ensure the success of the PACN.
Reflecting on my high school experience, I had the honor of serving as the captain of both the cross country and track and field teams. In these leadership positions, I managed the team by keeping an inventory of team uniforms and maintaining attendance records. Every day, I led warm-up sessions to prepare the team for meets, fostering a sense of camaraderie and discipline. My role also involved relaying important information from the coach to the team, ensuring everyone was well-informed and prepared for upcoming competitions.
These diverse experiences have equipped me with valuable skills in teaching, teamwork, and leadership. They have also deepened my appreciation for community engagement and cultural representation. Whether in the classroom, on the field, or through my involvement in student organizations, I am passionate about fostering creativity, inclusivity, and collaboration among my peers and students alike.
